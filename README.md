## Project Overview

Halo Fakepoint is powered by the [Halo API](https://autocode.com/halo/) and will be a center for players of the current Halo video game, Halo Infinte, to search statistics of themselves along with their friends and other players. They will also have a detailed page of their own statistics to view with one half being overall statistics and the other half focused on the ranked game mode. On the main search page there is a small section a user can manually add and remove friends based on gamertags they want to search. The settings page can be updated and changes will persist. While some features are still in development and to be added, the base functionality of an already "signed in" account is complete enough to the point I am comfortable to display it. 

### Prototype

I have created a prototype in Figma. You can view it at the link below and compare to the production view.
